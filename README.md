# Project 11: WTWR

## Overview

The WTWR project involves building a frontend React application that suggests clothing based on local weather data fetched from an API. The project utilizes technologies including JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, REST API, Git, and GitHub, focusing on advanced frontend skills and API integration.

Key features include:

- Displaying real-time weather data and conditions (e.g., temperature)
- Suggesting appropriate clothing items based on weather conditions
- Filtering clothing items by weather type (hot, warm, cold)
- BEM methodology for organized and maintainable code structure
- Two interactive modals, Add Clothes and Item Modal
- React & Vite framework
